# Qiskit_workshop
The coding challenges for the Qiskit fest.

What I have learned.

- From the first note book I learned how to create and display quantum circuits. And I learned how to analyze and sample that circuit and diplay the results.
- The second Notebook was more dificullt discussed about how more advantagous is to implement the VQE on a quantum computer vs the classical computers. I learn how to use the pass manager and the different level of optimizations.
- Lastly the third challenge thought me how the transpiling work. Transpiling is neseccasry as there are different backend quantum hardware and circuits need to be redesigned so that it is less effected by the noise. There are 6 stages of the transpilation which was discussed.
